Weather Forecast Application Development in JavaScript - SAMIM MONDAL
Point :
Create the basic project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
You need to use Tailwind CSS in this project.

Research and select a suitable weather API provider (e.g.,
OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI, etc.).

Design a simple and intuitive user interface using HTML and Tailwind CSS.

Responsiveness for various screen sizes (desktop, iPad Mini,
iPhone SE).

Allow users to search for weather forecasts by city name.
● Allow users to search weather forecasts for current location. 
● Add user interaction features such as buttons and input fields for
selecting locations and viewing different weather data. 
● Implement dropdown menu for recently searched cities (you can add
recently searched cities in dropdown using local or session storage).
Initially there should not be any dropdown since there is no searched city.
Clicking on any city in dropdown menu should update the weather data.

● Implement event listeners to handle user interactions and update the UI
accordingly. 
● Validate user inputs to prevent errors (e.g., invalid location, empty search
queries). 
● Fetch and display location specific weather forecasts, (e.g., temperature,
humidity, wind speed) for a user's location. 
● Use appropriate icons or graphics to represent weather conditions (e.g.,
sunny, cloudy, rainy).
